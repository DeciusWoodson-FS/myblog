# My Second Blog Post

## What's new

**Things I like to learn**: Despite everything I've come to learn so far, there are still a ton of thngs I'd like to learn and implement into my projects. One language in particular I'd like to be proficient in is TypeScript. It's gained a long of popularity and movements, and is in my opinion one of the cornerstones to being a better dev. I'm also interested in diving deeper in Reactas it still captivates my interest.to consolidate these learning, I've actually been reading Learning React with TypeScript, so far it's been a wonderful resource and I've been learning quite a lot.
