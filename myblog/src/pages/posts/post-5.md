# My Fourth Blog Post

Published on: 2025-12-15

## What's new

This past week, I worked on getting my quotes website set up for mobile using React Native, a framework I've been interested in utilizing for a long time now. Having used React thus for for my projects, Native was rather simple to pick up after learning some of the core components from the docs. The real fun came in seeing my application on the ios simulation and the API at work returning and taking data, I felt like a real mobile developer at work. I am satisfied with the results, but there's still much more I want to learn and experiment with concerning Native. Next time I work with it, I want to try my hand at incorporating Nativewind and try my hand at animations through loading screens and transitions. I have a side project I'd like to try putting on mobile as well.
