# My Second Blog Post

Published on: 2025-01-12

## What's new

1. **Updated pages and navigation**: I was able to get this site deployed and made, it's still rather rough around the edges, I'd like to consolidate the posts to show up on the blog page rather than open them on these random pages. I'd also like to add reusable components and cards with some small animations.

2. **Styling**: I managed to style the pages according to my tastes. I'm partial to a darker themed aesthetic so that's what I went for. I also used a global stylesheet to style both the home and blog page. It makes it easier to import them on each of the pages rather than typing out the code every time.
