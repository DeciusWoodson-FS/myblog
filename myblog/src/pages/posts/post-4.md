# My Fourth Blog Post

Published on: 2025-08-12

## What's new

This week I'd working on completing a Full Stack MERN application, ustilizing an API I built and deployed to return, read, update, and delete data. The premise of it is to add your favorite qutoes from any game or anime of your choosing, and add the characters associated with those quotes. Probably the most interesting part of the process was getting the initial API deployed after building it and returning data. I used Heroku to deploy both the front and backend, and at first it gave me a bit of trouble, but after including concurrently in the dependencies and fixing some typos, everything worked out perfectly. It's rather small in scale and nothing too impressive, but if you'd like to check it out and give it a try, it's deployed [here](https://animequotes-76d7bd234435.herokuapp.com/).
